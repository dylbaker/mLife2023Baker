Hello! I will give you a list of the figures/tables generated by each script file

CNP_Q_analysis.R : In charge of making figure S4 and Table 2

fig1.Rmd : makes figure 1, the phylogenetic tree with the heatmap and nmds plot

N_analysis: makes figures S1 and S3, and makes panel B of figure 2, which is outputted as an rds file to be combined with panel A in P_analysis

P_analysis: makes figure S2 and panel A of figure 2

nls_monod: makes table 1 and performs the nonlinear least squares regression on growth rate data to calculate the mumax and ks values seen in table 2, as well as doing statistical tests to show differences betweeen axenic and xenic state and across strains.

functions.R: Contains lots of useful functions that are used in nearly all of the above scripts. They are really bulky, so it makes sense to have them in a separate file. They include importing the data, statistical analyses, and a couple of other niche functions used in this analysis.

The 16S_analysis_raw_fastq folder is only for experienced users. The code in this folder was written by Dr Anders Kiledal. It was used to parse the raw fastq files and generate ASVs for each sample. Check the readme.md in that folder for further instructions.
