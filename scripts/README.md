Hello! I will give you a list of the figures/tables generated by each script file

CNP_Q_analysis.R : Figure S3, figure 5 (all panels), and table 1

fig1.Rmd : Figure 1, the phylogenetic tree with the heatmap and nmds plot. Panels 1A and 1B were combined in Adobe Illustrator.

N_analysis.Rmd: Figure S1, figure 2, and Figure 4B, which is outputted as an rds file to be combined with Figure 4A in     P_analysis.Rmd Generates growthrate estimates for limiting Nitrogen for use in models in nls_monod.Rmd

P_analysis.Rmd: Figures 3 and 4. Generates growthrate estimates for limiting Phosphorus for use in models in nls_monod.R

nls_monod.Rmd: Figure S2 and performs the nonlinear least squares regression on growth rate data to calculate the mumax and ks values seen in table 1, as well as doing statistical tests to show differences betweeen axenic and xenic state and across strains that ends up in Figure 5. Figure 5 is made in 'CNP_Q_analysis.R'.

functions.R: Contains lots of useful functions that are used in nearly all of the above scripts. They are really bulky, so it makes sense to have them in a separate file. They include importing the data, statistical analyses, and a couple of other niche functions used in this analysis.

The 16S_analysis_raw_fastq folder is only for experienced users. The code in this folder was written by Dr Anders Kiledal. It was used to parse the raw fastq files and generate ASVs for each sample. Check the readme.md in that folder for further instructions.
